1.1 Problem Description

Introduction: 
Clickthrough rate (CTR) __ is a ratio showing how often people who see your ad end up clicking it. Clickthrough rate (CTR) 
can be used to gauge how well your keywords and ads are performing.
CTR is the number of clicks that your ad receives divided by the number of times your ad is shown: clicks รท impressions = CTR.
For example, if you had 5 clicks and 100 impressions, then your CTR would be 5%.
Each of your ads and keywords have their own CTRs that you can see listed in your account.A high CTR is a good indication that users 
find your ads helpful and relevant. 
CTR also contributes to your keyword's expected CTR, which is a component of Ad Rank. Note that a good CTR is relative to 
what you're advertising and on which networks.
